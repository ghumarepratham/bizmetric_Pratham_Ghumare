## **Python Assignments and Bill Print Project**

This repository contains my Python practice assignments and a Bill Print Project.
The Bill Print Project is developed using OOPS concepts in Python.
It generates customer bills and calculates the total amount.
The project is connected to a database to store customer and bill item details.
All records are saved properly using database connectivity.
Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 include practice problems on lambda functions and basic Python concepts.
This repository is created for learning and practice purposes.

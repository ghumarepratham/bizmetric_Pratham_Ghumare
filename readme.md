# Python Projects and Assignments

This repository contains my Python learning projects and practice assignments.  
It includes two major OOP-based projects and two structured assignment sets.

## 1. Bill Printing System

This is my first Python project built using OOP concepts.  
It generates customer bills, calculates the total amount, and stores customer and item details in a database.  
The system is designed using multiple classes to manage customer information and billing logic separately.  

**OOP Concepts Used:** Encapsulation, Object Creation, Separation of Responsibilities

**Data Engineering Concepts Applied:** Relational Data Modeling (Customers & BillItems tables), Transaction Handling, Structured Data Ingestion, SQL-Based Data Persistence, Primary–Foreign Key Relationships, and a basic ETL-style workflow (User Input → Data Processing → Database Storage).

**Purpose:** To understand class structure, database connectivity, and real-world billing system logic.

## 2. Netflix Backend System

This project simulates a Netflix-like backend system using Python and SQL Server (SSMS).
It allows users to register, choose subscription plans (Basic, Standard, Premium), make payments, and add movies to favourites while ensuring structured data storage and integrity.
The system prevents duplicate email registrations using database constraints and fetches plan prices dynamically from the database to maintain data consistency and normalization.

**Classes Used:** Account, Plans, Payments, Movies  
Each class handles a specific responsibility to maintain clean and modular backend architecture.  

**OOP Concepts Used:** Encapsulation, Abstraction, Object Creation  
**Purpose:** To build structured backend logic with proper database validation and real-world workflow design.

**Data Engineering Concepts Applied:** Relational Data Modeling, Data Validation & Integrity Constraints, Transaction Handling, SQL-Based Data Retrieval, and Backend Data Pipeline Simulation.

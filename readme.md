## 1. Bill Printing System

This is my first Python project built using OOP concepts.  
It generates customer bills, calculates the total amount, and stores customer and item details in a database.  
The system is designed using multiple classes to manage customer information and billing logic separately.  

**OOP Concepts Used:** Encapsulation, Object Creation  
**Purpose:** To understand class structure, database connectivity, and real-world billing system logic.

## 2. Netflix Backend System

This project simulates a Netflix-like backend system using Python and SQL Server (SSMS).  
It allows users to register, choose subscription plans (Basic, Standard, Premium), make payments, and add movies to favourites.  
The system prevents duplicate email registrations and fetches plan prices directly from the database.

**Classes Used:** Account, Plans, Payments, Movies  
Each class handles a specific responsibility to maintain clean and modular backend architecture.  

**OOP Concepts Used:** Encapsulation, Abstraction, Object Creation  
**Purpose:** To build structured backend logic with proper database validation and real-world workflow design.
